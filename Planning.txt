I want to build a comprehensive market analysis app that:

Users can run different models 


#navbar for learning, options pricing, predict stock prices, company financials 

#company financials page workflow

* displays balance sheet, income statement, and cashflow statement 









Price Options
Black Scholes Model
Monte Carlo Stimulation 


Predict Stock Prices
Time Series analysis
Regression Modeling
Neural Network 
Web Scrape
* Financial News(sentiment), SEC Fillings, company reports


1. React Frontend for dashboard
2. Flask Backend 
3. Alpaca API for real time financial data
4. Yahoo Finance API for historical data 
5. Tensor Flow for Machine Learning
